\section{General Comments}
\begin{questions}
\item Don't be afraid to mini-lecture this week, as these are fairly difficult 
\item Focus on
\begin{itemize}
\item LLSE: all parts
\item Just do a few covariance problems if you are tight on time. 2.1 and 2.2.1 are good problems
\item Conditional Expectation: all parts
\end{itemize}
\item Covariance: Make the connection between the covariance formula and the variance formula, and why it makes sense to define covariance this way.
\begin{itemize}
\item Make sure to do covariance and conditional expectation first because LLSE relies on it
\item Explain what LLSE is, and why the formula makes sense--intuitively, why. If there is time or interest, prove it.
\end{itemize}

\item Conditional Expectation
\begin{itemize}
\item Make the connection between normal expectation and conditional expectation, and explain intuitively what conditional expectation means
\item Explain what LLSE is, and why the formula makes sense--intuitively, why. If there is time or interest, prove it.
\end{itemize}
