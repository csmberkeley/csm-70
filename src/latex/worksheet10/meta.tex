\section{General Comments}
\begin{questions}
\item Conditional Expectation
\begin{itemize}
\item Make the connection between normal expectation and conditional expectation, and explain intuitively what conditional expectation means
\item Explain what LLSE is, and why the formula makes sense--intuitively, why. If there is time or interest, prove it.
\end{itemize}
\item Continuous Probability
\begin{itemize}
\item Be sure to go over conditional expectation (we apologize for the confusion, all the TAs were under the impression we weren't covering it, then the professor went ahead and covered it).
\item Try to draw parallels between discrete and continuous; something that helps is writing out the sums and then replacing everything with integral (do calculus review as necessary)
\end{itemize}
