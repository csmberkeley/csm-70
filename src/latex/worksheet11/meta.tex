\section{General Comments}
\begin{itemize}
\item Be sure to go over conditional expecation (we apologize for the confusion, all the TAs were under the impression we weren't covering it, then the professor went ahead and covered it).
\item Try to draw parallels between discrete and continuous; something that helps is writing out the sums and then replacing everything with integral (do calculus review as necessary)
\end{itemize}
