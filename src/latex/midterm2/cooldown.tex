\textbf{Countability Cooldown} \newline
Consider the set of lists of length $k$, for positive integer $k$, where 
\[T_5 = {(x_1, \dotsc, x_k)| x_i \in S_i\text{ such that }S_i  \neq \emptyset}.\]

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item If any of $S$ are uncountably infinite, what is the cardinality of $T_5$?
\begin{solution}
$T_5$ is uncountably infinite.
\end{solution}

\item If all of $S$ are finite, is $T_5$ finite, countably infinite, or uncountably infinite? 
\begin{solution}
$T_5$  is finite.
\end{solution}

\item If none of $S$ are uncountably infinite and at least one is infinite, what is the cardinality of $T_5$?
\begin{solution}
$T_5$ is countably infinite.
\end{solution}

\end{enumerate}
