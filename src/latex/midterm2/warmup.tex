\question \textbf{Countability Warmup} \newline
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item Consider the set of all pairs of rational numbers: 
\[T_1 = {(x, y) | \text{ x,y rationals}}\]
Is $T_1$ finite, countably infinite, or uncountably infinite? Explain.
\begin{solution}
Countably infinite. 
Can use same proof that  NxN is countably infinite. (Cantor pairing)
\end{solution}

\item Consider the set of pairs where 
\[T_2 = {(x,y) | x \text{ is a natural number, }y \text{ is a real number}} \]
Is $T_2$ finite, countably infinite, or uncountably infinite? Explain.
\begin{solution}
Uncountably infinite. 
Use Cantor's Diagonalization on the second element.
\end{solution}

\item Consider the set of pairs where 
$T_3 = {(x,y) | x,y\text{ are bit strings of length }k}$
Is $T_3$ finite, countably infinite, or uncountably infinite? Explain.
\begin{solution}
Finite. Can count each one. How many are there?
\end{solution}

\item Consider the set of triples where 
\[T_4 = { (x,y,z) | x,y,z\text{ are rational numbers}}\]
Is $T_4$ finite, countably infinite, or uncountably infinite? Explain.
\begin{solution}
Countably infinite. From 1, know that $(x, y)$ is countably infinite. Use Cantor pairing to show $((x, y), z) \equiv (x, y ,z)$ is countably infinite.
\end{solution}
\end{enumerate}
