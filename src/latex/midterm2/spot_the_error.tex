\question \textbf{Spot the Error}\newline
Assume that $d = 1$, and we are told that 
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
P(1) &= 2 \\
P(2) &= 3 \\
P(3) &= 2 \\
P(4) &= 0  \\
p &= 5
\end{split}
\end{equation}
but we know there is exactly one incorrect point. 
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item What is $P(0)$? 
\begin{solution}
This is a line. Try deleting each and seeing whether a line fits the other three points. The line is $P(x) = x+1$, since 
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
P(1) &= 1+1 = 2 \\
P(2) &= 2+1 = 3 \\
P(4) &= 4+1 = 0
\end{split}
\end{equation}
\end{solution}

\item What is the error locator polynomial for Berlekamp-Welsh Algorithm for this situation?
\begin{solution}
$E(x) = x-3$
\end{solution}

\end{enumerate}
