\section{General Comments}
\begin{itemize}
\item Gauge calculus understanding and do a calculus review if necessary, 
especially integration (differentials (i.e. dx)). A conceptual
review would be nice. 
\item Highlight the analogs in discrete probability. 
\begin{itemize}
\item Problems 1,2, and 3 in 1.1 are good for this. 
\end{itemize}
\item Make sure they understand the difference and the relation between 
a PDF and a CDF.
\item Problem 5 in 1.1 is a solid ``test your students' understanding'' type question. 
\item Drawing out diagrams of the distributions might help.
\begin{itemize}
\item Especially normal distributions.
\end{itemize}
\item Try to cover the distributions part as much as possible, but adjust to your section. 
\end{itemize}
