\question Prove $a(n - a)\binom{n}{a} = n(n - 1)\binom{n - 2}{a - 1}$ 
by a combinatorial proof.
\begin{solution}[3cm]
Suppose that you have a group of $n$ players. The left-hand side is 
the number of ways to pick a team of $a$ of these players, designate 
one member of the team as captain, and then pick one reserve player 
from the remaining $n - a$ people. The right-hand side is the number 
of ways to pick the captain, then the reserve player, and then the 
other $a - 1$ members of the team.
\end{solution}
