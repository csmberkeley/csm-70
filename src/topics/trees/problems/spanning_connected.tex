\question A \textbf{spanning tree} of a graph $G$ is a subgraph of 
$G$ that contains all the vertices of $G$ and is a tree. \newline 
Prove that a graph $G = (V, E)$ if connected if and only if it contains 
a spanning tree.

\begin{solution}
First the “if” direction. If a graph contains a spanning tree, which 
is a connected graph that contains all the vertices, there is a path 
between any two vertices, so the graph is connected.\newline

Now the “only if.” Let $G$ be a connected graph. Either $G$ is already 
a tree, in which case it is its own spanning tree, or else there is an 
edge that can be removed from $G$ while it remains connected. Because 
there are only a finite number of edges, we can continue this process 
until no more edges can be removed, at which point we have found our 
spanning tree.
\end{solution}
