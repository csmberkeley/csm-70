\question Prove the following properties of trees.

\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*]
\item Any pair of vertices in a tree are connected by exactly one 
(simple) path.

\begin{solution}[1.6 in]
Pick any pair of vertices $x$, $y$. We know there is a path between 
them since the graph is connected. We will prove that this path is 
unique by contradiction:
Suppose there are two distinct paths from $x$ to $y$. At some point 
(say at vertex $a$) the paths must diverge, and at some point (say at 
vertex $b$) they must reconnect. So by following the first path from 
$a$ to $b$ and the second path in reverse from $b$ to $a$ we get a 
cycle. This gives the necessary contradiction.
\end{solution}

\item Adding any edge to a tree creates a simple cycle.

\begin{solution}[1.6 in]
Pick any pair of vertices $x$, $y$ not connected by an edge. We prove 
that adding the edge $(x,y)$ will create a simple cycle. From part (a), 
we know that there is a unique path between $x$ and $y$. Therefore, 
adding the edge $(x,y)$ creates a simple cycle obtained by following 
the path from $x$ to $y$, then following the edge $(x, y)$ from $y$ 
back to $x$
\end{solution}
\end{enumerate}
