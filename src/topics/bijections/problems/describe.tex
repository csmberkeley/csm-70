\question Describe a function that is injective but not surjective 
and the set over which this applies. How about a function that is 
surjective but not injective?

\begin{solution}
ex: $e^x$: $R \rightarrow R$ is injective (one to one) but not 
surjective (onto) because while all real numbers map to something, 
nothing will map to 0 and negative numbers.
x2: $x^2$: $R \rightarrow R^+$ is surjective (onto) but not injective 
(one to one) because while all positive real numbers have something 
mapping to them, 4 has -2 and 2 mapping to it.
\end{solution}
