\question Are the following functions \textbf{injections} 
from $Z_{12}$ to $Z_{24}$?
\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*.]
\item $f(x) = 2x$
\begin{solution}[0.2 in]
Yes: any two $x_1$ and $x_2$ will not equal each other as long as 
$x_1 \neq x_2$. 
\end{solution}

\item $f(x) = 6x$
\begin{solution}[0.2 in]
No. For example, 0 and 4 both map to 0.
\end{solution}

\item $f(x) = 2x + 4$
\begin{solution}[0.2 in]
Yes. This is the same as part (a), except shifted. 
\end{solution}
\end{enumerate}
