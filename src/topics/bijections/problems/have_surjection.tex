\question Why can we not have a surjection from $Z_{12}$ to $Z_{24}$ 
or an injection from  $Z_{12}$ to $Z_{6}$?

\begin{solution}
Because there are more values in $Z_{24}$ than $Z_{12}$, it is 
impossible to cover all the values in $Z_{24}$ with mapping from 
$Z_{12}$ . Similarly, because there are more values in $Z_{12}$ than 
$Z_{6}$, there is not a unique element in $Z_{6}$ to assign to every 
$Z_{12}$.
\end{solution}
