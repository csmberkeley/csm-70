\question Suppose you arrange 12 different cars in a parking lot, 
uniformly at random. Three of the cars are Priuses, four of the cars 
are Teslas, and the other five are Nissan Leaves. What is the 
probability that the three Prius's are all together? 

\begin{solution}
There are $12!$ possible ways to arrange the 12 cars. Now, there are 
$12 - 3+ 1 = 10$ different places the Prius’s could go (positions 
1,2,3, positions 2,3,4, all the way until positions 10,11,12). 
For each of those 10 places, there are 3! ways to arrange the Prius’s 
and 9! ways to arrange the other 9 cars in the 9 remaining spots. 
So, in total, there are $10*3!*9!$ ways of arranging the cars so that 
the 3 Prius’s are together. So the probability we get what we want is 
$\frac{10*3!*9!}{12! } ≈ .0455$
 \end{solution}
