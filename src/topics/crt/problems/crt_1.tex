\question Find an integer $x$ such that $x$ is congruent to $3 \mod 4$ and $5 \mod 9$.
\begin{solution}[1 in]
In general if $x$ can be expressed as
\begin{align*}
    x &\equiv a_1 \text{mod} m_1 \\
    x &\equiv a_2 \text{mod} m_2
\end{align*}
where $m_1$ and $m_2$ are relatively prime to each other, CRT tells us that there is an unique number mod $m_1m_2$ that satisfies this equation.

Since $m_1$ and $m_2$ are relatively prime, we can, using Euclid's algorithm, write an equation of the form
\[ 1 = (m_1^{-1} \pmod ) \]
\end{solution}
