\question Find an integer $x$ such that $x$ is congruent to $3 \mod 4$ and $5 \mod 9$.
\begin{solution}[.5 in]
We can express $x$ as: 
\begin{align*}
    x &\equiv 3 \mod 4 \\
    x &\equiv 5 \mod 9
\end{align*}
where $4$ and $9$ are relatively prime to each other. We write the congruence with the largest modulus as an equation, $x = 9t + 5$. We substitute into the other congruence and solve for $t$. $9t + 5 \equiv 3 \mod 4$, which means $9t \equiv 2 \mod 4$ and $t \equiv 2 \mod 4$. We write this congruence as an equation, $t = 4s + 2$, and substitute into the equation for $x$. $x = 9(4s + 2) + 5 = 36s + 23$. So $x = 23 \mod 36$ is the solution. Note that $lcm(4, 9) = 36.$
