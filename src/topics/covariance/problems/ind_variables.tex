\question Prove that if $X$ and $Y$ are independent, then $\cov(X, Y) = 0$:
\begin{solution}[2cm]
	\[\cov(X, Y) = \E(X \cdot Y) - \E(X) \cdot \E(Y)\]
Remember that a property of expectation is that if $X$ and $Y$ are 
independent, then $\E(XY) = \E(X) \cdot \E(Y)$, so we get 0 when we subtract
\end{solution}
