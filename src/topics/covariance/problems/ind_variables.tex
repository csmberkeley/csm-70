\question 
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item Prove that if $X$ and $Y$ are independent, then $\cov(X, Y) = 0$.
\begin{solution}[.75cm]
	\[\cov(X, Y) = \E(X \cdot Y) - \E(X) \cdot \E(Y)\]
Remember that a property of expectation is that if $X$ and $Y$ are 
independent, then $\E(XY) = \E(X) \cdot \E(Y)$, so we get 0 when we subtract. 
\end{solution}
\item Prove that the converse is not necessarily true. In other words, give an example of $2$ random variables whose covariance is $0$ but are not independent.
\begin{solution}[1cm]
There are a number of examples that can be used. \\
One possible solution: Let $X$ be a random variable that with uniform probability space \{-1, 1\}. Let $Y$ be a random variable such that $Y = 0$ if $X = -1$ and $Y$ is -1 or 1 with equal probability if $X = 1$. \\
\[\cov(X, Y) = \E(X \cdot Y) - \E(X) \cdot \E(Y)\]
$\E(X)$ and $\E(Y)$ = 0, so: 
\[\cov(X, Y) = \E(X \cdot Y)\]
\[\E(X \cdot Y) = \P(X = -1) \cdot -1 \cdot 0 + \P(X = 1, Y = 1) \cdot 1 \cdot 1 + \P(X = 1, Y = -1) \cdot -1 \cdot 1 = 0\]
So, $\cov(X, Y) = 0$. But, $X$ and $Y$ are clearly dependent, and thus this is a valid counterexample.

	Let $X \mathtt{\sim} U(-1, 1)$ and let $Y = X^2$ \newline
	
	We have $E[X] = \frac{-1+1}{2} = 0$ \newline
	The pdf of $X$ is $\frac{1}{2}$, so \newline 
	$E[Y] = E[X^2] = \int\limits_{-1}^{1}x^2f_X(x) dx = \int\limits_{-1}^{1}\frac{1}{2}x^2 = \frac{1}{3}$ \newline
	We also have $E[XY] = E[X * X^2] = E[X^3] = \int\limits_{-1}^{1}x^3f_X(x) dx
	=  \int\limits_{-1}^{1}\frac{1}{2}x^3 dx  = 0$ \newline
	cov$(X, Y) = E[XY] - E[X]E[Y] = 0 - 0 * \frac{1}{3} = 0$ \newline
	However, $Y$ is clearly dependent on $X$ as $Y = X^2$, and thus we provide a valid counterexample.
