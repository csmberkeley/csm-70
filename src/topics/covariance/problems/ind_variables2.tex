\question Prove that the converse is not necessarily true. In other words, give an example of $2$ random variables whose covariance is $0$ but are not independent.
\begin{solution}[2cm]
	Let $X \mathtt{\sim} U(-1, 1)$ and let $Y = X^2$ \newline
	
	We have $E[X] = \frac{-1+1}{2} = 0$ \newline
	The pdf of $X$ is $\frac{1}{2}$, so \newline 
	$E[Y] = E[X^2] = \int\limits_{-1}^{1}x^2f_X(x) dx = \int\limits_{-1}^{1}\frac{1}{2}x^2 = \frac{1}{3}$ \newline
	We also have $E[XY] = E[X * X^2] = E[X^3] = \int\limits_{-1}^{1}x^3f_X(x) dx
	=  \int\limits_{-1}^{1}\frac{1}{2}x^3 dx  = 0$ \newline
	cov$(X, Y) = E[XY] - E[X]E[Y] = 0 - 0 * \frac{1}{3} = 0$ \newline
	However, $Y$ is clearly dependent on $X$ as $Y = X^2$, and thus we provide a valid counterexample.
