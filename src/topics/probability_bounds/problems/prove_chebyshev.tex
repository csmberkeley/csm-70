\question Use Markov's to prove Chebyshev's Inequality.
\begin{solution}[3cm]
Define the random variable $Y = (X - \mu)^2$. We know that $\E(Y) =\E((X - \mu)^2) = \var(X)$. 
The event that we are interested in, $|X - \mu| \geq \alpha$, is exactly the same as the event $Y = (X - \mu)^2 \geq \alpha ^2$ .
Therefore, $\P[|X -\mu| \geq \alpha] = \P[Y \geq \alpha^2 ]$. \newline 
Moreover, $Y$ is non-negative, so we can apply Markov's inequality to get: 
\[\P[Y \geq \alpha^2] \leq \frac{\E(Y)}{\alpha^2} = \frac{\var(X)}{\alpha^2}\]
Substituting in $Y = (X-\mu)^2$ above and taking square roots yields the form we are used to.
