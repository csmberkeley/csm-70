\question Use Markov's to prove Chebyshev's Inequality:
\begin{solution}[5cm]
Define the random variable $Y = (X - \mu)^2$. Note that $\E(Y) =\E( 
(X - \mu)^2) = \var(X)$
Also, notice that the event that we are interested in, $|X − \mu| ≥ 
\alpha $ is exactly the same as the event $Y = (X − \mu)^2 ≥ \alpha ^2$ .
Therefore, $\P[|X −\mu| \geq \alpha] = \P[Y \geq \alpha^2 ]$. Moreover, 
$Y$ is non-negative, so we can apply Markov's inequality to it to get:
\[\P[Y \geq \alpha^2] \leq \frac{\E(Y)}{\alpha^2} = \frac{\var(X)}{\alpha^2}\]
\end{solution}
