\question \textbf As we all know, Berkeley squirrels are extremely fat and cute. 
The average squirrel is 40\% body fat. The standard deviation of body 
fat is 5\%. Provide an upper bound on the probability that a randomly 
trapped squirrel is either too skinny or too fat? A skinny squirrel 
has less than 27.5\% body fat, and a fat squirrel has more than 52.5\% 
body fat?

\begin{solution}[3cm]
We use Chebyshev's inequality. We are looking for the probability we 
fall within 2.5 standard deviations of the mean. By Chebyshev's 
inequality, the probability we are within this range is $\frac{1}{2.5^2}, or \frac{4}{25} = 0.16$.
If we were to use Markov's inequality, we would have probabilities over 1, which are unhelpful.
