\question \textbf{Bound It}\newline
A random variable $X$ is always strictly larger than $-100$. You know 
that $\E(X) = -60$. Give the best upper bound you can on $\P[X \geq -20]$.

\begin{solution}[3cm]
Notice that we do not have the variance of $X$, so Chebyshev's bound 
is not applicable here. 
Since $X$ is also not a sum of other random variables, other bounds or 
approximations(chernoff, Hoeffding's inequality. Don't worry about them if they are not covered.) are not available. This leaves us with just Markov's 
Inequality. But Markov Bound only applies on a non-negative random 
variable, whereas $X$ can take on negative values.

% There is no upper bound on $X$, so Hoeffding’s 
% inequality cannot be used. We know nothing else about its distribution 
% so we cannot evaluate $\E[esX]$ and so Chernoff bounds are not available. 
					
This suggests that we want to “shift” $X$ somehow, so that we can apply 
Markov’s Inequality on it. Define a random variable $Y = X + 100$, 
which means $Y$ is strictly larger than 0, since $X$ is always strictly 
larger than $-100$. Then, $\E(Y) = \E(X +100) = \E(X)+100 = -60+100 = 40$. 
Finally, the upper bound on $X$ that we want can be calculated via $Y$, 
and we can now apply Markov's Inequality on $Y$ since $Y$ is strictly 
positive.
					
$\P[X \geq -20] = \P[Y \geq 80] \leq \frac{\E(Y)}{80} = \frac{40}{80} = 
\frac{1}{2}$
					
Hence, the best upper bound on $\P[X \geq -20]$ is $\frac{1}{2}$.
