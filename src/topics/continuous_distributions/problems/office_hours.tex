\question There are on average 8 office hours in a day. The scores of an exam 
followed a normal distribution with an average of 50 and standard 
deviation of 6. If a student waits until an office hour starts, what 
is the expected value of the sum of the time they wait in hours and 
their score on the exam?

\begin{solution}[0.5cm]
    Model the beginnings of office hours as $8$ points throughout a 24-hour day.
    Model the student's arrival as $1$ point in a 24-hour day.
    Then in total there are $9$ points distributed throughout a 24-hour day.
    By symmetry, the expected time interval from the student's arrival to the next office hour is $\frac{24}{9}$.

    \begin{align*}
        \E(\text{waiting time}) = \frac{24}{9} \\
        \E(\text{score}) = \E(\mathcal{N}(50, 36)) = 50 \\
    \end{align*}
By linearity of expectation, the sum is $52 \frac{2}{3}$.

\end{solution}
