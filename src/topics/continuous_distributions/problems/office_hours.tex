\question There are on average 8 office hours in a day. The scores of an exam 
followed a normal distribution with an average of 50 and standard 
deviation of 6. If a student waits until an office hour starts, what 
is the expected value of the sum of the time they wait in hours and 
their score on the exam?

\begin{solution}[0.5cm]
Since the student and the office hours lie on the same distribution, there is no
difference between when the student comes and when the office hours are held. So

\E(waiting time) = \E(exp(lambda=9/24)) = 8/3 \\
\E(score) = \E(normal(50, 36)) = 50 \\
By linearity of expectation, the sum is $52 \frac{2}{3}$.
\end{solution}
