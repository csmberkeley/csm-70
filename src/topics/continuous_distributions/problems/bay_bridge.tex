\question Every day, 100,000,000,000 cars cross the Bay Bridge, following an 
exponential distribution. 
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*.)]
\item What is the expected amount of time between 
any two cars crossing the bridge?
\begin{solution}[0.5 cm]
$\frac{1}{100,000,000,000}$ days
\end{solution}

\item Given that you haven’t seen a car cross the bridge for 5 minutes, how 
long should you expect to wait before the next car crosses?
\begin{solution}[0.5cm]
$\frac{1}{100,000,000,000}$ days
\end{solution}  
\end{enumerate}
