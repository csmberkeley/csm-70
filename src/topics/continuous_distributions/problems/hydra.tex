\question There are certain jellyfish that don’t age called hydra. The 
chances of them dying is purely due to environmental factors, which 
we’ll call $\lambda$. On average, 2 hydras die within 1 day.
What is the probability you have to wait at least 5 days for a 
hydra dies?
\begin{solution}[1cm]
$\lambda = 2, X \sim Exp(2)$ \\
$P(X\geq 5) = \int_5^\infty \lambda e^{-\lambda x} dx = \int_5^\infty 
2e^{-2x} dx = -e^{-2x} |_5^\infty = e^{-10} = \frac{1}{e^{10}}$
\end{solution}
