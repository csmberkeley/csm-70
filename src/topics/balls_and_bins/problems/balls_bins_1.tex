Given $n$ bins and $m$ balls find the largest value of $m$ such that the probability that there is no collision is above $\frac{1}{2}$? \textit{Hint: Use the union bound to approximate. Recall, the union bound states that $P(A_1 \cup A_2 \cup ... \cup A_n) \leq P(A_1) + P(A_2) + ... + P(A_n)$}.
    \begin{solution}[1.5 in] Let $A$ be the event that there are no collisions. We know we have $\binom{m}{2} = k$ pairs of balls. Let $A_i$ be the probability that pair $i$ collides. $\Pr[A_i]$ is simply $\frac{1}{n}$, so by the union bound, we have 
    \[\Pr[\overline{A}] \leq \sum_{i=1}^{k} \Pr[A_i] = k \left(\frac{1}{n}\right) = \frac{m(m-1)}{2n}\approx \frac{m^2}{2n}\]
    So we have that $\frac{m^2}{2n} = \frac{1}{2}$ and so $m \leq \sqrt{n}$.
