We can use two representations for polynomials: value representation and coefficient representation.
\begin{enumerate} 
    \item Value representation: if polynomial $P(x)$ has degree $n - 1$ then we can uniquely reconstruct it from any $n$ distinct points 
    \item Coefficient representation: if a polynomial $P(x)$ has degree $n - 1$ then it can be uniquely described by its $n$ coefficients 
\end{enumerate}\\
