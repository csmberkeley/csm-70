\begin{enumerate} 
\item There is a unique polynomial of degree $n-1$ such that $P(i) = m_i$ 
for each packet $ m_1, \dotsc, m_n$
\item To account for errors we send $c_1=P(1), \dotsc, c_{n+j}=P(n+j)$
\item If polynomial $P(x)$ has degree $n - 1$ then we can uniquely 
reconstruct it from any $n$ distinct points. 
\item If a polynomial $P(x)$ has degree $n - 1$ then it can be uniquely 
described by its $n$ coefficients 
\end{enumerate}\\
