\question \textbf{Bet On It} \\*
Smith is in jail and has 3 dollars; he can get out on bail if he has 
8 dollars. A guard agrees to make a series of bets with him. If Smith 
bets A dollars, he wins A dollars with probability 0.4 and loses A 
dollars with probability 0.6.
\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
\item
Find the probability that he wins 8 dollars before losing all of his 
money if he bets 1 dollar each time.

of Smith's money has diagram

Let $\phi(i)$ be the probability that the chain reaches state 8 before 
reaching state 0, starting from state $i$. In other words, if $S_j$ is 
the first $n \leq 0$ such that $X_n = j$, 
\begin{equation}
P_i(S_8 < S_0) = P(S_8 < S_0|X_0 = i)
\end{equation}
Using first-step analysis (viz. the Markov property at time $n = 1$), 
we have 
\begin{align*}
\phi(i) &= 0.4 \phi(i + 1) + 0.6 \phi(i - 1),\ i = 1, 2,3,4,5,6,7 \\
\phi(0) &= 0 \\
\phi(8) &= 1.
\end{align*}
We solve this system of linear equations and find
\begin{align*}
\phi &= (\phi(1), \phi(2), \phi(3), \phi(4), \phi(5), \phi(6), \phi(7)) \\
&= (0.0203, 0.0508, 0.0964, 0.1649, 0.2677, 0.4219, 0.6531, 1).
\end{align*}
E.g. the probability that the chain reaches state 8 before reaching 
state 0, starting from state 3 is the third component of the vector 
and is equal to $0.0964$. Note that $\phi(i)$ is increasing in $i$, 
which was expected.
