\question \textbf{Tossing Coins} \\*
A fair coin is tossed repeatedly and independently. Find the expected 
number of tosses till the pattern HTH appears.
\begin{solution}[3cm]
Call HTH our target. Consider a chain that starts from a state called 
nothing $(\emptyset)$ and is eventually absorbed at HTH. If we first 
toss H then we move to state H because this is the first letter of our 
target. If we toss a T then we move back to $\emptyset$ having expended 
1 unit of time. Being in state H we either move to a new state HT if 
we bring T and we are 1 step closer to the target or, if we bring H, 
we move back to H: we have expended 1 unit of time, but the new H can 
be the beginning of a target. When in state HT we either move to HTH 
and we are done or, if T occurs then we move to $\emptyset$. The 
transition diagram is

Let $\phi(i)$ be the expected number of steps to reach HTH starting 
from $i$. We have 

\begin{align*}
\phi(HT) &= 1 + \frac{1}{2} \phi(\emptyset) \\
\phi(H) &= 1 + \frac{1}{2} \phi(H) + \frac{1}{2} \phi(HT) \\
\phi(\emptyset) &= 1 + \frac{1}{2} \phi(\emptyset) + \frac{1}{2} \phi(H)
\end{align*}
We solve and find $\phi(\emptyset) = 10$.
