\question 
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item
You have 15 chairs in a room and there are 9 people. How many different 
ways can everyone sit down?
\begin{solution}[1 in]
$\frac{15!}{6!}$
There are 15 places to put the first person, then 14 places to put the 
second person, 13 places to put the third person, etc… all the way to 
the last person who has 7 places to sit
Another way to think about this is like the anagram example above. We 
have 9 unique “letters” and 6 repeats (our empty spaces). We divide by 
the repeats giving us:
$15*14*13*12*11*10*9*8*7 = \frac{15!}{6!}$
 \end{solution}
 
\item How many ways are there to fill 9 of the 15 chairs? (We don’t 
care who sits in them)

\begin{solution}
${15 \choose 9}  = \frac{15!}{9!(15-9)!}$
In this example, we don’t care about the uniqueness of each person, 
so we can just count each person as a “repeat”. So like the anagram 
example we’ll divide for every repeat. We have 9 human repeats, and 
6 empty space repeats. Hence $\frac{15!}{9!6!}$
\end{solution}

\end{enumerate}
