\textit{Example Question}: How many ways can we distribute 7 dollar bills amongst 3 students? \newline

Approaching this with the approaches we currently know fails: There are 7 possible options for the number of bills you give to the first student, but the number of bills you choose to give the first student has a \textit{direct} effect on the numbers of bills you can give to the second student - previously, if I had 7 options for the first student and choose one of the options, the second student always had 6 options to choose from. However, this is not the case in our example: if I choose to give the first student 5 dollars, for example, the second student can only get 1 or 2 dollar bills. \newline

How do we solve this problem? We need to format it slightly differently: put the dollar bills on a line, and then try to insert 2 dividers. Everything to the left of the first divider is given to the first student. Everything in the middle of the 2 dividers is given to the second student. And everything to the right of the second divider is given to the 3rd student: \newline 
\textbf{\textdollar $\vert$ \textdollar \textdollar \textdollar \textdollar $\vert$ \textdollar \textdollar} \newline 		
\textit{In the above example, the first student gets 1 dollar, the second 4, and the 3rd 2 dollars.} \newline

So we can see that the idea is to count how many ways we can arrange the 7 identical dollar bills and 2 identical dividers. Every permutation leads to some valid, distinct distribution of the money! From the previous sections we can see that we will have $ \frac{9!}{7!2!} = {9 \choose 2}  = 36 $ ways to arrange the bills and dividers, and therefore 36 ways to distribute the money.

This tactic of using dividers is commonly referred to \textit{stars and bars} or \textit{sticks and stones}. \newline

 \textbf{General problem:} We want to distribute $n$ indistinguishable items amongst $k$ people.
 \textbf{General solution:} ${n+k-1 \choose k}$ \newline

\textit{Balls and Bins:} \newline
\textbf{Distributing $n$ \underline{distinguishable} balls amongst $k$ \underline{distinguishable} bins:} Each ball has $k$ possible bins to go into, and there are $n$ balls. Solution: $k^{n}$ \newline
\textbf{Distributing $n$ \underline{indistinguishable} balls amongst $k$ \underline{distinguishable} bins:} Classic stars-and-bars. Solution: ${n+k-1 \choose k}$ \newline
\textit{Note}: Distributing balls among indistinguishable bins is not covered in CS 70!
