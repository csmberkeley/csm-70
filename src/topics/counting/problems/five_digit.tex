\question How many 5-digit sequences have the digits in non-decreasing order?

\begin{solution}[.5 in]
This can be framed as a stars and bars problem. We have 9 bars between the numbers 0 through 9 and must place 5 stars in these slots. The location of a star represents the value of its associated digit. This ensures the 5 numbers in our sequence are either repeated or increasing. So, the answer is ${14 \choose 9} = 2002$. Note that if the question asked about increasing order, we would not use the stars and bars approach.
