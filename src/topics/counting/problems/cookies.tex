\question How many ways can you give 10 cookies to 4 friends if each 
friend gets at least 1 cookie?

\begin{solution}[2 cm]
Give out 4 “necessary” cookies, then count the number of ways to give 
6 cookies to 4 friends if some can get no cookies. 6 choices from 4 
options with repetition, so the number of ways is  
$(6 + 4 - {1\choose 4} - 1)  =  {9 \choose 3}  = 84.$
\end{solution}
