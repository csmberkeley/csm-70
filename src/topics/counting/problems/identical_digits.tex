\question \textbf{Identical Digits}
The numbers 1447, 1005, and 1231 have something in common. Each of them 
is a four digit number that begins with 1 and has two identical digits. 
How many numbers like this are there?
\begin{solution}[0.5 in]
Case 1: the identical digits are 1 (e.g. $11xy, 1x1y, 1xy1$) \\*
Since there can only be two numbers that are identical, x and y cannot 
be 1 and $x \neq y$. \\*
So [Possible formats] * [Possible x values] * [Possible y values] $= 
3 * 9 * 8 = 216$ \\
Case 2: identical digits are not 1 (e.g. $1xxy, 1xyx, 1yxx$). \\* So 
[Possible formats] * [Possible x values] * [Possible y values] 
$= 3 * 9 * 8 = 216$ \\
Add both cases to arrive at the final result. $216 + 216 = 432$
\end{solution}
