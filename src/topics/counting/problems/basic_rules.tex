\textbf{Rules of counting:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item
If an object is made by a sequence of k choices, the number of ways to make the object is the number of ways to make the first choice, multiplied by the number of ways to make the second choice, and so on.
\item
If the order does not matter, then count the number of ways to arrange the situation with order and then divide by the number of orderings/sorted objects.
\end{enumerate} \\
