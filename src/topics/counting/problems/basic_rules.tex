\textbf{Counting:} \newline
In this class, the basic premise of counting is determining the total number of possible ways something can be done. Reaching a particular outcome requires a number of specific choices to be made. In counting, we determine the number of ways we can make these choices and reach different outcomes. To figure out the total number of outcomes, we multiply together the number of potential choices at each step. \newline
