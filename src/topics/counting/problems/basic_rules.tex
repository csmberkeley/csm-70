\textbf{Rules of counting:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item
If an event is composed of different independent events, then we can multiply together the probabilities of the independent events. 
\item
If the order does not matter, then count the number of ways to arrange the situation with order and then divide by the number of orderings/sorted objects.
\end{enumerate} \\
