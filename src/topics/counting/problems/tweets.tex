\question The local library got itself a Twitter account! 
It appears to have been active for only a short time, but while it 
was running it diligently tweeted one 140-character message per day. 
Assume that it uses only the 26 letters of the English alphabet 
(plus the period, comma, and space) and that any 140-character 
combination is possible (e.g. “asdfasdf. . .as” and “,,,,,,. . . ,,,,” 
are both perfectly valid). 

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item How many possible tweets are there? 
\begin{solution}
$29^{140}$
\end{solution}

\item How many tweets use no spaces? 
\begin{solution}
$28^{140}$
\end{solution}

\item How many tweets consist entirely of whitespace? 
\begin{solution}
1
\end{solution}

\item Let $T$ be some particular tweet. How many tweets differ from $T$ by exactly one character? 
\begin{solution}
$140*28 = 3920$
\end{solution}

\item How many have exactly six spaces and five commas? 
\begin{solution}[1 cm]
${140 \choose 6} * {134 \choose 5} * 27^{129} = 
\frac{140!}{6!5!128!} * 27^{129}$
\end{solution}
\end{enumerate}
