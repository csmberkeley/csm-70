\question In Jorge Luis Borges’ “The Library of Babel,” the narrator 
describes a massive library: Every book in the library has 410 pages, 
each page has 40 lines, and each line has 80 characters. Besides 
lowercase letters, the only characters appearing in the books are the 
period, the comma, and the space. In order to catch up with the 21st 
century, the Library got itself a Twitter account (@LibraryofBabel )! 
It appears to have been active for only a short time, but while it 
was running it diligently tweeted one 140-character message per day. 
Assume that it uses only the 26 letters of the English alphabet 
(plus the period, comma, and space) and that any 140-character 
combination is possible (e.g. “asdfasdf. . . as” and “,,,,,,. . . ,,,,” 
are both perfectly valid). 

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item How many possible tweets are there? 
\begin{solution}[1 cm]
$29^{140}$
\end{solution}

\item How many tweets use no spaces? 
\begin{solution}[1 cm]
$28^{140}$
\end{solution}

\item How many tweets consist entirely of whitespace? 
\begin{solution}[1 cm]
1
\end{solution}

\item Let $T$ be some particular tweet. How many tweets differ from $T$ by exactly one character? 
\begin{solution}[1 cm]
$140*28 = 3920$
\end{solution}

\item How many have exactly six spaces and five commas? 
\begin{solution}[1 cm]
${140 \choose 6} * {134 \choose 5)} * 27^{129} = 
\frac{140!}{6!5!128!} * 27^{129}$
\end{solution}
\end{enumerate}
