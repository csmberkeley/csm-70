\question How many solutions does $x + y + z = 10$ have, if all variables 
must be positive integers? 

\begin{solution}[.5 in]
We can think of this in terms of stars and bars. Bars can't be next to each 
other since variables are all positive integers. So $n = 10$ stars, 
$k = 3$ bars. Answer = ${n-1 \choose k-1} = {9 \choose 2} = 36$.
\end{solution}
