\question How many ways can you deal 13 cards to each of 4 players 
so that each player gets one card of each of the 13 values 
(A, 2, 3. . .K)? 
\begin{solution}[.5 in]
There are $4!$ ways to distribute the aces to the 4 players, $4!$ ways to distribute the twos, and so 
on, so the number of ways to deal the cards in this manner is 
$4!^{13} = 24^{13}$ .
\end{solution}
