\question How many ways can you deal 13 cards to each of 4 players 
so that each player gets one card of each of the 13 values 
(ace-2-3-. . . -king)? 
\begin{solution}[2 cm]
Approach this problem value by value: \\ 
There are 24 or $4!$ ways to distribute the aces to the 4 players. \\
There are also 24 ways to distribute the twos. \\
This pattern can be seen for every card that can be distributed. \\
$\therefore 4!^{13} = 24^{13}$ .
\end{solution}
