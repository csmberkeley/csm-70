\question How many ways can you deal 13 cards to each of 4 players 
so that each player gets one card of each of the 13 values 
(ace-2-3-. . . -king)? 
\begin{solution}[2 cm]
Approach this problem value by value: there are 24 ways to distribute 
the aces to the 4 players $4!$, 24 ways to distribute the twos, and so 
on, so the number of ways to deal the cards in this manner is 
$4!^{13} = 24^{13}$ .
\end{solution}
