\textbf{The Halting Problem:} Does a given program ever halt when executed 
on a given input?

\end{center}

How do we prove that \texttt{TestHalt} doesn’t exist? Let’s assume that it does, 
and hope we reach a contradiction. \newline
Define another program:
\begin{center}

\end{center}
What happens when we call \texttt{Turing(Turing)}?
\begin{solution}[5 cm]
\begin{description}
\item[Case 1]: It halts
If \texttt{Turing(Turing)} halts then \texttt{TestHalt(Turing, Turing)} 
must have returned no. But \texttt{TestHalt(Turing Turing)} calls 
\texttt{Turing(Turing)} and calling \texttt{Turing(Turing)} must loop. 
But we assumed that \texttt{Turing(Turing)} halted. Contradiction.
\item[Case 2]: It loops
This implies that \texttt{TestHalt(Turing, Turing)} returned yes, which by the 
way that \texttt{TestHalt} is defined implies that \texttt{Turing} halted. 
But we assumed  that \texttt{Turing(Turing)} looped. Contradiction.
\end{description}
\end{solution}

How is this just a reformulation of proof by diagonalization?
\begin{center}

\end{center}
\begin{solution}[1.3 in]
List all possible programs as rows and columns. The rows are the programs 
and the columns are the inputs. Turing must be one of the rows, say row $n$. 
If entry $(n, n) $ is $H$ then Turing will loop by definition. If entry 
$(n, n)$ is $L$ then Turing will halt by definition. Therefore Turing 
cannot be on the list of all programs and therefore it does not exist. 
\end{solution}

Therefore the Halting Problem is unsolvable. We can use this to prove 
that other problems are also unsolvable. Say we are asked if program $M$
is solvable. To prove it is not, we just need to prove the following claim: 
If we can compute program $M$, then we could also compute the halting problem.

This would then prove that $M$ can not exist, since the halting problem 
is not computable. This amounts to proof by contradiction.
