\question Determine the computability of the following tasks. If it's not computable, write a reduction or self-reference proof. If it is, write the program.\\
\begin {enumerate}
\item You want to determine whether a program $P$ on input $x$ prints "Hello World!" Is there a computer program that can perform this task? Justify your answer? \\
\begin{solution}[.3 in]
Define a program that takes programs as inputs, and prints Hello World at the end of the execution of the program:
\\
\texttt{def reduce(input):}\\
\hphantom{xyz}\texttt{execute(input)}\\
\hphantom{xyz}\texttt{print("Hello World")}\\
Now if we have some arbitrary program input $x$, if we call \\
\texttt{testHelloWorld(reduce(x))}, we will be able to solve the Halting Problem, so we know that this is impossible.\\
\end{solution}
\item You want to determine whether a program $P$ prints "Hello World!" before running the $kth$ line of the program.
\begin{solution}[.3 in]
Similar to the last program, we can write a reduction program:\\
\texttt{def reduce(input):}\\
\hphantom{xyz}\texttt{execute(input)}\\
\hphantom{xyz}\texttt{print("Hello World")}\\
\end{solution}
\item You want to determine whether a program $P$ prints "Hello World!" in the first $k$ steps of its execution. Is there a computer program that can perform this task? Justify your answer?\\
\begin{solution} [.1 in]
Yes, you can run the program until $k$ steps are executed. If $P$ has halted by then, return true. If not, return false.
\end{solution}
\end{enumerate}
