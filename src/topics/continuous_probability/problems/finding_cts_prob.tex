\question For a discrete random variable $X$ we have $\Pr[X \in [a, b]]$ 
that we can calculate directly by finding how many points in the 
probability space fall in the interval and how many total points are 
in the probability space. How do we find $\Pr[X \in [a, b]]$ for a 
continuous random variable?
\begin{solution}[0.5in]
For a continuous RV with probability density function $f(x)$, the 
probability that $X$ takes on a value between $a$ and $b$ is the area 
under the pdf from $a$ to $b$, which is the integral from $a$ to $b$ 
of $f(x)$.
