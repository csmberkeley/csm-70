\question Jim and George are setting up venture capital portfolios. 
Suppose that Jim picks $n + 1$ startups to fund and George picks $n$ 
startups to fund. Suppose that the probability of any startup succeeding 
is $\frac{1}{2}$  and all of the startups succeed or fail independently. 
What is the probability that Jim picks more successful startups than 
George?
\begin{solution}[5cm]
Since Jim picks one more startup than George, it is impossible that 
they pick both the same number of successful startups and the same 
number of unsuccessful startups. So Jim picks either more successful 
startups than George or more unsuccessful startups than George (but not 
both). Since the probability of
succeeding is $\frac{1}{2}$, these events are equally likely by symmetry, 
so both events have
probability $\frac{1}{2}$.
\end{solution}
