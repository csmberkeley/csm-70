\question Find an example of 3 events A, B, and C such that each pair 
of them are independent, but they are not mutually independent.
\begin{solution}[4 cm]
Consider a fair 4-sided die. Let A be the event that 1 or 2 appears in 
a die roll, B be the event that 1 or 3 appears, and C be the event 
that 1 or 4 appears.Then, 
\[Pr(A) = Pr(B) = Pr(C) = \frac{1}{2}\] 
Furthermore, 
\[Pr(A \cap B) = Pr({1\text{ appears}}) = \frac{1}{4} = Pr(A) Pr(B).\]
So A and B are pairwise independent. Similarly (A, C) and (B, C) are 
pairwise independent. However, 
\[Pr(A \cap B \cap C) = Pr({1\text{ appears}}) = \frac{1}{4} = Pr(A) 
Pr(B) Pr(C) = \frac{1}{8}\]
So these 3 events are not mutually independent.The answer is not unique; 
any other valid answer is acceptable.
