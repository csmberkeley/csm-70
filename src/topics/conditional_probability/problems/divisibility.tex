\question Say that we pick a number at random from $1$ to $90$, inclusive. What is the probability that is divisible by $2, 3$, or $5$?\\

\begin{solution}[1 cm]
We can just apply the Inclusion-Exclusion principle here. If events $A$, $B$, and $C$ represent the events of being divisible by $2, 3$, and $5$ respectfully, then $\P(A\cup B \cup C) = \P(A) + \P(B) + \P(C) - \P(A \cap B) - \P(A \cap C) - \P(B \cap C) + \P(A\cap B \cap C) = \frac{45}{90} + \frac{30}{90} + \frac{18}{90} - \frac{15}{90} - \frac{9}{90} - \frac{6}{90} + \frac{3}{90} = \frac{66}{90} = \frac{11}{15}$.
