\question A lie detector is known to be 80\% reliable when the person 
is guilty and 95\% reliable when the person is innocent. If a suspect 
is chosen from a group of suspects where only 1\% have ever committed 
a crime, and the test indicates that the person is guilty, what is the 
probability they are innocent?
\begin{solution}[2 cm]
Let I and G be the events that the person is innocent and guilty 
respectively, and let $L_I$ and $L_G$ be the events that the test 
says innocent or guilty. 
\[P(I | L_G) = 
\frac{P(L_G | I)*P(I)}{ 
 P(L_G | I)*P(I) + P(L_G | G)*P(G) } = \frac{0.05*0.99}{0.05*0.99 + 0.8*0.01} = 0.86\]
 \end{solution}
