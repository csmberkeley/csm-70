\question Define a probability distribution over a set of events $S$ to be $\textit{uniform}$ if the probability of each event in the set occurring is equal. Find a joint distribution on $X$ and $Y$ such that $X$ and $Y$ are each uniform on the set $\{1,2,3,4\}$, but $(X,Y)$ is not uniform on the set $\{1,2,3,4\} \times \{ 1,2,3,4 \}$.\\

\begin{solution}[.75 cm]
$\P(X = x, Y = y) = \frac{1}{4}, \text{ for }x=y.$\\ 
$\P(X = x, Y = y) = 0, \text{ for }x\neq y$
\end{solution}
