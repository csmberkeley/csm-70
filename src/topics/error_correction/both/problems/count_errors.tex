\question Suppose that the message we want to send consists of 10 
numbers. We find a polynomial of degree 9 which goes through all these 
points and evaluate it on 25 points. How many erasure errors can we 
recover from? How about general errors?
\begin{solution}[1 in]
\textbf{Erasure}: $n + k =$ \# points to send\newline
	$10 + k = 25$ \newline
	$k = 15$ erasure errors\newline
\textbf{General}: $n + 2k =$ \# points to send\newline
	$10 + 2k = 25$\newline
	$k = 7$ general errors.
\end{solution}
