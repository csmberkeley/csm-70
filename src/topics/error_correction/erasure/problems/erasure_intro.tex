We want to send $n$ packets and we know that $k$ packets could get lost. 
We use a polynomial under GF($q$).

How many more points does Alice need to send to account for $k$ possible errors?
\line(1,0){10}
\begin{solution}
$k$
\end{solution}

What degree will the resulting polynomial be? \line(1,0){15}
\begin{solution}
$n - 1$
\end{solution}

How large should $q$ be if Alice is sending n packets with k erasure errors, 
where each packet is a integer between $0$ and $m$?
\newline
\begin{solution}[1 in]
Modulus should be larger than $n+k$ and larger than $m$ and be prime
\end{solution}

What would happen if Alice instead send $n + k - 1$? Why will Bob be 
unable to recover the message?
\begin{solution}[1 in]
Bob will receive $n - 1$ distinct points and needs to reconstruct a 
polynomial of degree $n - 1$. By Fact \#3 this is impossible. There are 
$q$ polynomials of at most degree $n - 1$ in $GF(q)$ that go through the 
$n - 1$ points that Alice sent. 
\end{solution}
