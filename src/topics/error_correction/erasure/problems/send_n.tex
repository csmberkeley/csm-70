\question Suppose we want to send $n$ packets, and we know $p = 20\%$ 
of the packets will be erased. How many extra packets should we send? 
What happens if $p$ increases (say to $90\%$)?
\begin{solution}
We want to have $(1-p)*(n + k) = n$, where $k$ is the number of 
additional packets we send. Solving for $k$, we get $\frac{n}{1 - p} - n$.  
When $p$ is large, we have to send many times the number of original packets. 
(fraction packets not erased)*(how many packets are sent) = (number 
packets in original message)
\end{solution}
