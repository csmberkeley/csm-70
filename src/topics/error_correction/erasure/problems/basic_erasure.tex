\question Suppose $A = 1$, $B = 2$, $C = 3$, $D = 4$, and $E = 5$. Assume we want to send a message for which the information is contained in 3 packets. Recover the lost part 
of the message, or explain why it cannot be done. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item C\_AA
\begin{solution}[.4in]
$P(0) = 3, P(2) = 1, P(3) = 1$.  $q$ must be greater than $m$, which is 5, and $n+k$, which is 4, and also prime. The smallest number that satisfies these conditions is 7, so we interpolate the polynomial 
over $\mod 7$ and get $5x^2 + 3x + 3$. Now, once we evaluate 
this at 1, we get 4. So, in the end, it'€™s CDAA.
\end{solution}
\item CE\_ \_
\begin{solution}[.4in]
Impossible. In order to get the original degree 2 polynomial, we 
need at least 3 points. 
\end{solution}
\end{enumerate}
