\question What are the tens and units digits of $7^{1900}$?
\begin{solution}[.5cm]
Since we're only looking for the tens and units digits, we can just find the $7^{1900} \mod 100$, the remainder when $7^{1900}$ is divided by 100. We write down the first few powers of $7 \mod 100$ and see that $7^{4} = 2401 = 1 (\mod 100)$. So, $7^{1900} \mod 100 = 7^{4 \times 475}  = 1^{475} = 1 \mod 100$. So, our units digit is 1 and tens digit is 0.
