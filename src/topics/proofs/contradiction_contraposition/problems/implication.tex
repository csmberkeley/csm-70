\question Prove or disprove: If $P \implies Q$ and 
$R \implies \lnot Q$, then $P \implies \lnot R$.

\begin{solution}[3in]
Use the contrapositive of the second statement 
$P \implies Q \implies \neg R$

Alternatively, we can use proof by contradiction. 
Assume $P$ does not imply $\lnot R$. This means both $P$ and $R$ 
can be true at the same time. But, we know that if $P$ is true, $Q$ 
is true and if $R$ is true, $\lnot Q$ is true. This is a contradiction, 
as $Q$ and $\lnot Q$ cannot both be true. Hence, if $P$ is true, not 
$R$ must be true. Hence, $P \implies \lnot R$.
