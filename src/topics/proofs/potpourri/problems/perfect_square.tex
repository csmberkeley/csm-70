\question Prove or disprove the following statement: If $n$ is a 
positive integer such that $\frac{n}{3}$ leaves a remainder of 2, 
then $n$ is not a perfect square.

\begin{solution}[3in]
This is easiest done by looking at the contrapositive of the statement.
We shall prove that if n is a perfect square, then $\frac{n}{3}$ does 
not leave a remainder of 2.\newline

 Any number divided by 3 can only have a remainder of 0, 1, or 2. 
 Let's examine every case.\newline

 Case 1: Let's say $n = (3m)^2$, where $m$ is some integer, then 
 $n = 9m^2$, which is divisible by 3 and leaves no remainder.\newline

 Case 2: Let's say $n = (3m + 1)^2$, then $n = 9m^2 + 6m + 1$, 
 which is equal to $3(3m^2 + 2m)+1$, which is a number divisible by 
 3 plus one. Hence, when we take n to be this number and divide it by 
 3, we will have a remainder of 1.\newline

 Case 3: Let's say $n = (3m + 2)^2$, then $n = 9m^2 + 12m + 4$, which 
 is equal to $3(3m^2 + 4m + 1) + 1$, which is a number divisible by 3 
 plus 1. When we set n to be this number and divide it by 3, we obtain 
 a remainder of 1.\newline

Hence, in every case, we either obtain a remainder of 0 or a remainder 
of 1, but never a remainder of 2. We have proved the contrapositive to 
be true and hence, the original statement is True.\newline
