\question McDonaldâ€™s sells chicken McNuggets only in 6, 9, and 20 
piece packages. This means that you cannot purchase exactly 8 pieces, 
but can purchase 15. The Chicken McNugget Theorem states that the 
largest number of pieces you cannot purchase is 43. Formally state 
the Chicken McNugget Theorem using quantifiers.

\begin{solution}
The theorem has two components: (i) you cannot purchase 43 pieces, and 
(ii) you can purchase any number larger than 43 pieces. The correct 
translation of the theorem is:  \[\nexists a,b, c \in N, 6a+9b+20c = 43 
\and \forall n \geq 44, \exists a,b, c \in N, 6a+9b+20c = n\]
\end{solution}
