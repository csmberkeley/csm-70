\question In a large field, $n$ people are standing so that for each 
person, the distances to every other person is different. At a given 
signal, each person fires a water pistol and hits the person who is 
closest to them. When $n$ is odd, prove that there is at least one 
person who is left dry.

\begin{solution}
Do this by induction: \newline
Base case : 1 person is trivial\newline
Inductive Hypothesis: Assume that for $k$ odd, there is one person 
left dry.\newline
Inductive Step: For $(k+2)$ people, consider the two people closest 
to each other. This is unique (given by the problem), and these two 
people necessarily shoot each other. Therefore, the problem reduces 
to $k$ people, which we know must have one person left dry by 
hypothesis.
\end{solution}
