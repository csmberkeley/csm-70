\question Let $x$ be a positive real number. Prove that if 
$x$ is irrational (i.e., not a rational number), then $\sqrt{x}$ 
is also irrational.

\begin{solution}[3in]
Proof by Contradiction:
Suppose an irrational number $x$ such that $\sqrt{x}$ is rational.
By definition of rational, $\sqrt{x} = \frac{a}{b}$ for some integers 
$a$ and $b$ with $b \neq 0$. Then $x = (\sqrt{x})^2 = (\frac{a}{b})^2 
= \frac{a^2}{b2}$. But $a^2$ and $b^2$ are both integers 
(being products of integers), and $b \neq 0$ by the zero product property. 
Hence, $x$ is rational (by definition of rational). This contradicts the 
supposition that $x$ is irrational, and so the supposition is false. 
Therefore, the square root of an irrational number is irrational.
