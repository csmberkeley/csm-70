\question For any integer $x$, $x^2$ has remainder 1 or 0 when 
divided by 3.

\begin{solution}[3in]
We approach the solution by cases. \newline
Case 1: $x = 3k$ for some integer $k$.\newline
$x^2 = 9k^2 = 3(3k^2)$. Thus $x^2$ has remainder 0 when 
divided by 3.\newline

Case 2: $x = 3k + 1$ for some integer $k$\newline
$x^2 = 9k^2 + 6k + 1 = 3(3k^2 + 2k) + 1$. Thus, $x^2$ has 
remainder 1 when divided by 3.\newline

Case 3: $x = 3k + 2$ for some integer $k$\newline
$x^2 = 9k^2 + 12k + 1 = 3(3k^2 + 4k) + 1$. Thus, $x^2$ has 
remainder 1 when divided by 3.\newline
Since every integer falls into one of the three cases, it must be 
the case that the square of any integer has remainder 1 or 0 when 
divided by 3.
