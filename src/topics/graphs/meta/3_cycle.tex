\item \textbf{3 Cycle} 

For solving, it is easiest to proceed directly. When drawing out the graph on the board, draw something with 8 vertices, but have it be in two halves, 4 lined up on the left and 4 lined up on the right. Use the top left node as your example, donâ€™t draw edges for every node, that make too much clutter. The way to proceed is to show that since each node connects with 5 nodes, the top left node has to be connected to nodes from both sides. Then, take a second node, one that the first connected too, and show that there is no way to draw 5 edges without connecting to another node that the first node connected to. This alone is not the full formal solution but it should create a strong intuition.
