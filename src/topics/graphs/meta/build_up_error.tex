\item \textbf{Build Up Error}
\begin{enumerate}[label=(*)]
\item For \#6, many students do not know what buildup error is, so be ready to explain that thoroughly. If you want another good example of how buildup error can happen, the chocolate bar example from week 1 works well too. 
\item Buildup error isnâ€™t inherently wrong; correct solutions can be written by creating an instance of an n+1 case from an n case. However, this is usually a very slippery slope as doing so lends itself to overly strong assumptions and non-generalizable conclusions.
