\question  Suppose we want to represent a round-robin tennis tournament in which every player plays one match against every other player. How might we represent this using a graph?
\begin{solution}[1 in]
Have a node for each player. For every pair of players $(u, v)$, place an edge from the winner to the loser. This kind of graph is referred to as a tournament. 

This is similar to a complete graph, but it is directed.
\end{solution}

\question  What is a simple path?
\begin{solution}[1 in]
A sequence of edges where the vertices are necessarily distinct.
