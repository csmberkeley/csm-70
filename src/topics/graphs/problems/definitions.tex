\question  What is a tournament?
\begin{solution}[1 in]
A directed graph for which any pair of vertices, $u, v$ either have an edge $u \rightarrow v$ or $v \rightarrow u$. It can be used to represent a tournament in which every pair of player play at least once.
\end{solution}

\question  What is a simple path?
\begin{solution}[1 in]
Sequence of edges where the vertices are distinct
