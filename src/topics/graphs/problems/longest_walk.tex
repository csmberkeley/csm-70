\question Let $v$ be an odd degree node. Consider the longest walk 
starting at $v$ that does not repeat any edges (though it may omit 
some). Let $w$ be the final node of the walk . Show that $v \neq w$.
\begin{solution}[3 in]
Proof by contradiction.
Assume that the longest walk does get stuck at $v$. 
This means that at some point in the walk we entered vertex $v$ and 
there were no more untraversed edges.
Now pair up the incoming and departing edges as in the notes.
Every time we entered vertex $v$ before we got stuck, we also left it.
Pair up the first edge we traverse when we leave with the last edge 
we traverse when we got stuck.
This must imply that we used up an even amount of edges incident to 
$v$.
But $v$ is of odd degree (assumption)
Therefore there must be at least one untraversed edge when we entered 
$v$ the last time.
But now we have that we got stuck and there is an untraversed edge. 
Contradiction. We must not get stuck at $v$.
\end{solution}
