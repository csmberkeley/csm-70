\question Prove that every undirected finite graph where every vertex 
has degree of at least $3$ has a cycle of even length.

\begin{solution}
Let $P$ be a maximal path and $v$ be an endpoint of $P$.
$v$ has at least 3 neighbors that are on $P$ (why?)
Let the path $P$ be: $(\dotsc x, y, z, v)$
Now consider the following three paths: $v \rightarrow y$, $y 
\rightarrow x \rightarrow v$, and $y \rightarrow z \rightarrow v$
The union of two of these paths is a cycle.
At least two of these paths must have lengths that are both even or 
both odd. Adding either of those cases together creates an even length cycle.
\end{solution}
