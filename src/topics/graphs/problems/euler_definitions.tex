An \textbf{Eulerian path} is a path that uses every edge exactly 
once.\newline

An \textbf{Eulerian tour} is a path that uses each edge exactly 
once and starts and ends at the same vertex.\newline

\textbf{Eulerâ€™s Theorem}: An undirected graph $G=(V, E)$ has an 
Eulerian tour if and only if $G$ is even degree and connected 
(except possibly for isolated vertices).\newline
