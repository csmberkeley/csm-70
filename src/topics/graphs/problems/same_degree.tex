\question Prove that undirected connected graph with $|V| \geq 2$, 
$2$ nodes have same degree
\begin{solution}
Pigeonhole principle. Suppose graph $G$ has $n$ vertices.
What is the minimum degree of any vertex? 1
What is the maximum degree of any vertex? $n - 1$
So all degree values must be : $(1, \dotsc, n - 1)$
But there are $n$ vertices.
\end{solution}
