\question Prove that every undirected finite graph where every vertex 
has degree of at least $2$ has a cycle.

\begin{solution}[1 in]
Assume that it does not have a cycle.
So we have a graph $G$ that is connected and does not have a cycle. 
It must be a tree.
Every tree has at least one leaf. Leaves have degree 1. But we assumed 
that every vertex has degree at least 2. Contradiction, there must be 
a cycle.
\end{solution}
