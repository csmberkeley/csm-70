\question If every node has even degree except two nodes that 
have odd degree, prove that the graph has a Eulerian path.

\begin{solution}
First, add an edge from one odd degree vertex $X$ to the other 
odd degree $Y$. This modified graph has an Eulerian Tour by Euler`s 
Theorem. This tour contains something like $Z \rightarrow X \rightarrow 
Y \rightarrow \dotsc \rightarrow Z,$ where $\dotsc \rightarrow Z$ 
contains every edge in the original graph. Deleting an edge leaves a 
Eulerian path in the graph. 
\end{solution}
