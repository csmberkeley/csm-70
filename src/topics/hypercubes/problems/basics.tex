\question How many vertices and edges does an $n$ dimensional hypercube have?
\begin{solution}[0.6in] $2^n$ vertices, $n * 2^{n-1}$ edges
\end{solution}

\question How many edges do you need to cut from a hypercube 
to isolate one vertex in an $n$-dimensional hypercube? 
\begin{solution}[0.6in] $n$ because each node has $n$ edges.
\end{solution}
