\question Lemma: The pairing is stable.   \newline

\begin{solution}[3 in]
\begin{proof}  Direct proof!
\begin{itemize}
\item[] Let $(M, W)$ be a couple in the pairing produced by SMA. 
Suppose $M$ prefers $W*$ to $W$.
\item[] $W*$ is higher in $M$â€™s preference 
list than $W$.
\item[] $M$ must have proposed to $W*$ before he proposed to $W$.
\item[]  $W*$ must have rejected $M$ to someone she prefers more, 
call him $M*$.
\item[] By the Improvement Lemma $W*$ likes her final partner at 
least as much as $M*$.
\item[] $W*$ prefers her final partner to $M$.
\item[] Thus, the pairing is stable.
\end{itemize}
\end{proof}
