\question Lemma: Algorithm terminates with a pairing. \newline

\begin{solution}[2.8 in]
\begin{proof} Contradiction
\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=4mm]
\item Negate the lemma: Suppose, \underline{\smash{ there is a man 
who is unpaired when }} \newline \underline{\smash{ the algorithm ends.
}}
\item How many women has he proposed to? \underline{\smash{ $n$}}
\item  By the \underline{\smash{Improvement Lemma}}, each woman  
\underline{\smash{has someone on a string since }} \newline 
\underline{\smash{  $M$ proposed to each of them.}}
\item How many women have at least one man on a string? 
\underline{\smash{$n$}}
\item Man $M$ is not on anyone's string.
\item At least how many men are there? \underline{\smash{$n+1$}}	  
(Contradiction!) 
\end{enumerate}
\end{proof}
