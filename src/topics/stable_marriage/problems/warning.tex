\noindent
It should be noted that even though the TMA creates pairings that are male optimal, these pairings can also be male pessimal. Consider the following preferences:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $M_1$: $W_1 > W_2$
	\item $M_2$: $W_2 > W_1$
	\item $W_1$: $M_1 > M_2$
	\item $W_2$: $M_2 > M_1$
\end{itemize}
In this case, there is only one possible stable pairing â€“ $\{(M_1, W_1), (M_2, W_2)\}$. That means this pairing is both the best possible and worst possible, for both the men and women.
