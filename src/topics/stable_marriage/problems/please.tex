\question A person $x$ is said to prefer a matching $A$ to a 
matching $A$\ensuremath{'} if $x$ strictly prefers her/his partner 
in $A$ to her/his partner in $A$\ensuremath{'} . Given two stable 
matchings $A$ and $A$\ensuremath{'} , a person may prefer one to 
the other or be indifferent if she/he is matched with the same person 
in both. Suppose now that $A$ and $A$\ensuremath{'} are stable 
matchings, and suppose that $m$ and $w$ are partners in $A$ but not 
in $A$\ensuremath{'} . Prove that one of $m$ and $w$ prefers $A$ to 
$A$\ensuremath{'} , and the other prefers $A$\ensuremath{'} to $A$.
