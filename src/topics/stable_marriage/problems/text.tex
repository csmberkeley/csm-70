The Algorithm:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Every Morning}: Each man proposes to the \underline{\smash{most preferred}} woman on his list who has not yet rejected him. 
\item \textbf{Every Afternoon}: Each woman collects all the proposals she received in the morning; to the man she likes best, she responds “maybe, come back tomorrow” (she now has him \underline{\smash{on a string}}), and to the others, she says “never”. 
\item \textbf{Every Evening}: Each rejected man crosses off the woman who rejected him from his list.
The above loop is repeated each successive day until \underline{\smash{each}} woman has a man on a string; on this day, each woman marries the man she has on a string.
\end{enumerate}
Definitions: \newline
\tab M and W are a rogue couple if they prefer to be with each other as opposed to the \newline \tab people they are paired with \newline
\tab A pairing is stable if there are no rogue couples \newline
Lemmas: \newline
\tab The algorithm halts. \newline
\tab If man M proposes to woman W on the kth day, then on every subsequent day W \newline \tab has someone on a string whom she likes at least as much as M.
