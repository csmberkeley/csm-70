Given a set of $n$ men and $n$ women, and a list of each person's preferences, how can we create pairs of
one man and one woman, such that everyone is content with their pairing?

\vspace{.1in}
\textbf{The Algorithm}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Every Morning}: Each man proposes to the \underline{\smash{most preferred}} woman on his list who has not yet rejected him. 
\item \textbf{Every Afternoon}: Each woman collects all the proposals she received in the morning; to the man she likes best, she responds “maybe, come back tomorrow” (she now has him \underline{\smash{on a string}}), and to the others, she says “never”. 
\item \textbf{Every Evening}: Each rejected man crosses off the woman who rejected him from his list.
The above loop is repeated each successive day until \underline{\smash{each}} woman has a man on a string; on this day, each woman marries the man she has on a string.
\end{enumerate}
