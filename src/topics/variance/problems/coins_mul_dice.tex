\question Say you're playing a game with a coin and die, where you 
flip the coin 3 times and roll the die once. In this game, your score 
is given by the number of heads that show multiplied with the die result. 
What is the expected value of your score? Whatâ€™s the variance?

\begin{solution}[3cm]
$\E(XY) = \E(X)\E(Y) =\frac{21}{4}$ since $X$ and $Y$ are independent.
$\var(XY) = \E(X^2Y^2) - \E(XY)^2 = \E(X^2)\E(Y^2) - \E(X)^2 \E(Y)^2$
               $= 3*\frac{91}{6} - \frac{3}{2}^2 * \frac{7}{2}^2 = 
               \frac{91}{2} - \frac{9}{4} * \frac{49}{4} = 17.9375 = \frac{287}{16}$
