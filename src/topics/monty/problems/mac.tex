\question \textbf{Macs and Monty} \newline
Suppose instead of the normal Monty Hall scenario in which we have two 
empty doors and a car residing behind the third we have a car behind 
one door, a Mac behind another, and nothing behind the third. \newline
Let us assume that the contestant makes an initial pick at his/her 
discretion (random) and the host proceeds to ALWAYS open the empty door. 
When the contestant's initial choice corresponds to the empty door, 
the host will say so and the contestant must switch. \newline
Does the typical Monty Hall paradox of $\frac{2}{3}$ chance of obtaining 
the car by switching versus a $\frac{1}{3}$ chance of obtaining the car 
by staying apply in this particular case?

\begin{solution}[7 cm]
No. The normal Monty Hall paradox holds because when another door is 
opened, you learn nothing about your door, so the chance that you 
picked the right door from the beginning remains $\frac{1}{n}$ (which 
means the chance of the other door must be $\frac{n-1}{n}$). However, 
in this case, you may learn something about your door--you may be told 
that it must be wrong for example--thus shattering the paradox. 
These are all of the possible scenarios: \newline

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l | c || r}
\hline
Initial Pick & Switch? & Win? \\
\hline
Car & Yes & Lose \\
Car & No & Win \\
Mac & Yes & Win \\
Mac & No & Lose \\
Empty & Yes (to car) & Win \\
Empty & Yes (to car) & Lose \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
Switching results in a win 50\% of the time, so there is a 50\% chance 
of winning regardless of strategy.
 \end{solution}
