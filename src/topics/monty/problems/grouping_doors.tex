\question \textbf{Grouping Doors} \newline
Now we have 6 doors. You pick 1 and the other 5 doors are divided into 
two groups: one with 2 doors and the other with 3 doors. He removes doors
until each group has 1 door left. Do you switch? What do you switch to?	

\begin{solution}[3 cm]
Choose the door that was part of the group of three doors. When the doors 
were split up into three groups, those groups each had a probability of 
$\frac{1}{6}, \frac{2}{6},\text{ and } \frac{3}{6}$. These probabilities 
do not change when doors are removed, so three remaining doors each have 
probability $\frac{1}{6}, \frac{2}{6},\text{ and } \frac{3}{6}$. 
 \end{solution}
