\textbf{The Problem} : \newline
Suppose a contestant is shown 3 doors. There is a car behind one of them 
and goats behind the rest. Then they do the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Contestant chooses a door.
\item Host opens a door with a goat behind it.
\item Contestant can choose to switch or stick to original choice
\end{enumerate}
Is the contestant more likely to win if they switch?

At step 1, what is the probability that the car is behind the door the 
contestant chose? What is the probability that the car is behind the 
other two doors?
