\question Suppose that N is the secret number, and is restricted to be one of 0,1,2,3,4.
A person decides to divide this secret into four shares by using the following K,L secret sharing scheme. (He has kept the identity of K and L hidden from the people he is sharing the secret with).


To person i, where i is either 1,2,3, or 4, he gives the share $S_{i} = N +K*i+L*i^{2}$ mod 5.Suppose that three individuals had the following shares: $S_{1} = 2$,$S_{2} = 0$,$S_{3} = 2$. Calculate the secret N and show your work.

\begin{solution}
$S_{1} = N +K +L = N +K +L = 2 (mod 5) $...A

$S_{2} = N +2K +4L = N +2K +4L = 0 (mod 5) $...B

$S_{3} = N +3K +9L = N +3K +4L = 2 (mod 5) $...C

$B - A$ : K +3L = 3 (mod 5) ...D

$C - B$ : K = 2 (mod 5), which means K = 2 mod 5.

Substitute K=2 into D:

2+3L = 3 (mod 5) and then L = 2 (mod 5)

Substitute K = 2,L = 2 to A: N +4 = 2 (mod 5) and then N = 3 (mod 5)

The secret N = 3.

\end{solution}
