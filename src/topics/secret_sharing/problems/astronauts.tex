\question You want to send a super secret message consisting of 10 
packets to the space station through some  astronauts. You are afraid 
that some malicious spy people are going to tell the wrong message and 
make the space station go spiraling out of orbit. Assuming that up to 
5 of the astronauts are malicious, design a scheme so that the group of 
astronauts (including the malicious ones) still find the correct message 
that you want to send. You can send any number of astronauts, but try to 
make the number that you have to send as small as possible. Astronauts 
can only carry one packet with them.
\begin{solution}[2 in]
We can use the scheme provided in the notes for general errors. If 
there are up to 5 malicious astronauts, then we have up to 5 general 
errors in our transmission. To account for those errors and to send 
the original message we have to send at least the length of the original 
message plus the twice the possible number of general errors. Thus, 
we have to send 20 astronauts or more. Create a polynomial of degree 
9 (which is the length of the message minus 1), such that $P(0), P(1), 
\dotsc, P(10)$ is the original message, and give each of the 20 
astronauts unique points on that polynomial. Then use the methods we 
used in the previous question to find the message.
\end{solution}
