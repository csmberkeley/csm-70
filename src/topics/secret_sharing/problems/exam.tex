\question Suppose the Oral Exam questions are created by $2$ TAs 
and $3$ Readers. The answers are all encrypted and we know that:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item Together, both TAs should be able to access the answers
\item All 3 Readers can also access the answers
\item One TA and one Reader should also be able to do the same
\end{enumerate}

Design a secret sharing scheme to make this work.

\begin{solution}
Use a $2$ degree polynomial which requires at least $3$ shares to 
recover the polynomial. Generate a total of 7 shares, give each Reader 
a share, and each TA 2 shares. Then, all possible combinations will 
have at least $3$ shares to recover the answer key. Basically the point 
of this problem is to assign different weights to different classes of 
people. If we give one share to everyone, then $2$ Readers can also 
recover the secret and the scheme is broken.
\end{solution}
