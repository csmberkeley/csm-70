\question Given the random variable $X$ defined as taking on the value 
1 with probability 0.25, 2 with probability 0.5, and 20 with probability 
0.25, what is the expectation of $X$?
\begin{solution}[1cm]
$\E(X) = 0.25*1 + 0.5*2 + 0.25*20 = 6.25$ \\ 
%To find $var(X)$, we will first find $E(X^2)$.
%$E(X^2) = .25 * 1^2 + .5 * 2^2 + .25 * 20^2 = 102.25$
%Then, $var(X) = E(X^2) - E(X)^2 = 102.25 - (6.25)^2 = 63.19$.
\end{solution}
