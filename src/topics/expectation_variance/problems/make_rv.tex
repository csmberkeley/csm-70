\question You win the lottery with probability .01. If you win, you get \$10000. You lose with probability .99 and get no money. Define a random variable to represent this. 

\begin{solution}[1cm]
We define a random variable X that has value 10000 with probability .01 (the event that you win the lottery) and value 0 with probability .99 (the event that you do not). 
\end{solution}

%Make a random variable from the probability space: \{2, 3, 6, 7\} 
%that half the time is 1 and the other half the time is 0. What function 
%can represent this random variable?
%Several answers: $x < 5, x\%2 = 0, (x = 2 or x = 7)$, etc.
