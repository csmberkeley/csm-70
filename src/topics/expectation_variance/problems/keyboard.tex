\question A monkey types at a 26-letter keyboard with one key corresponding to each of the lower-case
English letters. Each keystroke is chosen independently and uniformly at random from the 26
possibilities. If the monkey types 1 million letters, what is the expected number of times the
sequence "book" appears?

\begin{solution}[.5 in]
There are $1000000-4+1 = 999997$ places where "book" can appear, each with a (nonindependent)
probability of $\frac{1}{26}^4$ of happening. If A is the random variable that tells how
many times "book" appears, and $A_i$ is the indicator variable that is 1 if "book" appears starting
at the $i$th letter, then
\[\E[A] = \E[A_1 + ... + A_999997] = \E[A_1] + ... + \E[A_999997]\]
\[=\frac{999997}{26^4}\]
\end{solution}
