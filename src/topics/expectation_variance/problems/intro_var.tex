\textbf{Variance}: The variance of a random variable $X$ is defined as $$\var(X) = \E((X - \E(X))^2)\ = \E(X^2) - \E(X)^2$$ The latter version of variance is the one we usually use in computations. \\
The square root of $\var(X)$ is called the standard deviation of $X$. It is usually denoted with the variable $\sigma$. \\
Important property of variance: for some constant $c$, \[\var(cX) = c^2 * \var(X)\].
