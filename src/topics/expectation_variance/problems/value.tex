\question Suppose $X$ is a random variable. Does $X$ always have to take on the value $E(X)$ at some point?
\begin{solution}[2cm]
No. Consider $X$ with probability mass function $P(X = x) = 0.1x$ for $x = 1, 9$ and $0$ elsewhere. The expectation of $X$ is $0.1 * 1 + 0.9 * 9 = 8.2$, however $X$ never takes on the value 8.2.
\end{solution}
