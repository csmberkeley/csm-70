\question In an arcade, you play game A 10 times and game B 20 times. Each time you play game A, you
win with probability $\frac{1}{3}$ (independently of the other times), and if you win you get 3 tickets
(redeemable for prizes), and if you lose you get 0 tickets. Game B is similar, but you win with
probability $\frac{1}{5}$, and if you win you get 4 tickets. What is the expected total number of tickets
you receive?

\begin{solution}[4 cm]
Let $A_i$ be the indicator you win the $i$th time you play game A and $B_i$ be the same for game B.
The expected value of $A_i$ and $B_i$ are:
\begin{center}
\[\E[A_i] = 1*\frac{1}{3} + 0*\frac{2}{3} = \frac{1}{3}\]
\[\E[B_i] = 1*\frac{1}{5} + 0*\frac{4}{5} = \frac{1}{5}\]
\end{center}
Let $T_A$ be the random variable for the number of tickets you win in game A, and $T_B$ be the number of tickets you win in game B. 
\begin{center}
\[\E[T_A + T_B] = 3\E[A_1] + ... + 3\E[A_{10}] + 4\E[B_1] + ... + 4\E[B_{20}]\]
\[=10*(3*\frac{1}{3}) + 20*(4*\frac{1}{5}) = 26 \]
\end{center}
\end{solution}
