\question Now you are trying to guess the 6-digit factorization digit 
by digit. Letâ€™s assume that when you finish putting these digits together, 
you can figure out how many digits you got right. Use zeros for blank 
spaces. For example, to guess 25, you would put 000025

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item What kind of distribution would you use to model this?
\begin{solution}[1cm]
Binomial, since this is multiple independent trials that can either 
succeed or fail.
\end{solution}

\item What is the probability that you get exactly 4 digits right?
\begin{solution}[2cm]
${6 \choose 4} * \frac{1}{10}^4 * \frac{9}{10}^2$
\end{solution}		

\item What is the probability that you get less than 3 correct?
\begin{solution}[1cm]
${6 \choose 2} * \frac{1}{10}^2 * \frac{9}{10}^4 + {6 \choose 1} * 
\frac{1}{10} * \frac{9}{10}^5 + {6 \choose 0} * \frac{1}{10}^0*\frac{9}{10}^6$
		\end{solution}
\end{enumerate}
