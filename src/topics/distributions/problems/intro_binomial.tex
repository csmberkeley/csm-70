\textbf{Binomial Distribution: Bin(n, p)}
Number of successes when we do n independent trials. Each trial has a 
probability $p$ of success. The probability of having $k$ successes:
\[ \P[X = k] = {n \choose k} * p^k * (1 - p)^{n - k}  \]
The expectation of a binomial distribution is:
\[ \E(X) = np \]
The variance of a binomial distribution is:
\[ Var(X) = np(1-p) \]

\begin{solution} % walkthrough of deriving E(X) for Binomial
Can walk through the derivation of $\E(X)$: 
We would have to compute this sum:
\[\E(X) = \sum_{k} k * \P[X = k] = \sum_{k = 0}^{n} k * {n \choose k} * 
p^k * (1 - p)^{n - k} \]

Instead of doing that just use Bernoulli variables:
\[ X = X_1 + \dotsc + X_n \]

And now use linearity of expectation:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\E(X) = \E(X_1 + \dotsc + X_n) = \E(X_1) + \dotsc + \E(X_n) \nonumber
\end{split}
\end{equation}

Since the probability of a success happening at each step is $p$, and 
there are $n$ steps, we are just summing $p$  $n$ times.
