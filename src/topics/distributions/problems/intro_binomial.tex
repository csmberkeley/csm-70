\textbf{Binomial Distribution}: Bin($n$, $p$) \\

The binomial distribution is used to count the number of successes in $n$ independent trials. Each trial has a probability $p$ of success. For this reason, we can think of the binomial distribution as a sum of $n$ independent Bernoulli trials, each with probability $p$. 

The probability of having $k$ successes:
$$\P[X = k] = {n \choose k} * p^k * (1 - p)^{n - k}$$

\textit{Expectation}: \\
$$E(X) = E(X_1 + \dotsc + X_n) = E(X_1) + \dotsc + E(X_n) = np$$

\textit{Variance}: \\
Since our sum of Bernoulli trials is independent, we can do the following:
$$var(X) = var(X_1 + X_2 + ... + X_n) = var(X_1) + var(X_2) + ... + var(X_n) = np(1-p)$$
