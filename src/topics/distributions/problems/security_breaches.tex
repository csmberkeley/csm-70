\question You are Alice, and you have a high-quality RSA-based security 
system. However, Eve is often successful at hacking your system. You 
know that the number of security breaches averages 3 a day, but varies greatly.

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item What kind of distribution would you use to model this?
\begin{solution}[2cm]
Poisson! That's what we use to model the probably frequencies of rare 
events.
\end{solution}

\item What is the probability you experience exactly seven attacks 
tomorrow? At least seven (no need to simplify your answer)?
\begin{solution}[2cm]
\[\P[X=7] = \frac{\lambda^7 * e^{-\lambda}}{7!} = \frac{3^7 * 
e^{-3}}{7!} \approx 0.0216\]
\[\P[X \geq 7] = \sum_{i=7}^{\infty}\P[X = i] = \sum_{i = 7}^{\infty} 
\frac{3^i}{i!} * e^{-3} \]
\end{solution}

\item What is the probability that, on some day in April, you experience 
exactly six attacks?
\begin{solution}[2cm]
\[\P[X=6] = \frac{3^6 * e^{-3}}{6!} \approx 0.0504 \]
\[1 - (1 - 0.0504)^{30} \approx 0.788 = 78.8\%\]
\end{solution}
