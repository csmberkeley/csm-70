\textbf{Bernoulli Distribution}: Bernoulli($p$)

We say $X$ has the Bernoulli distribution if it takes on value $1$ with probability $p$, and value $0$ with probability $1-p$. With the Bernoulli distribution we can model a single countable event, i.e. a single coin flip.
\\
\textit{Expectation}:
$$E(X) = 0*(1-p) + 1*p = p$$
\\
\textit{Variance}:
$$var(X) = E(X^2) - E(X)^2 = 0^2 * (1-p) + 1^2 * p - p^2 = p(1-p)$$
