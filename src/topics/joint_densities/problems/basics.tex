\question Let X, Y be independent uniform random variables on [0, 2]. 

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)] 
\item What is the joint density $f_{X, Y}(x, y)$? 
\begin{solution}[1cm] 
Since X and Y are independent, we know that $f_{X, Y}(x, y) = f_X(x) f_Y(y)$. \\ 
Both $f_X(x)$ and $f_Y(y)$ are uniform (0, 2) random variables, so $f_X(x) = \frac{1}{2}$ and $f_Y(y) = \frac{1}{2}$. Thus, $f_{X, Y}(x, y) = f_X(x) f_Y(y) =  \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} =  \frac{1}{4}$. 
\end{solution}

\item What is the probability that $X^2 + Y^2 < 4$? 
\begin{solution}[1cm]
The domain for the joint density is the square $[0, 2] \times [0, 2]$. Notice that $X^2 + Y^2 = 4$ gives us a circle with radius 2. The event ($X^2 + Y^2 < 4$) is the region bounded by the square and the circle. Thus, $P(X^2 + Y^2 < 4) = \iint f_{X, Y} (x, y) dx dy =$ area $\times f_{X, Y} (x, y) = \frac{1}{4} \times \pi \times 2^2 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{\pi}{4}$ 
\end{solution}
\end{enumerate}
