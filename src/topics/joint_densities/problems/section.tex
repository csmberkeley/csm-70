\question Five students are enrolled in a CSM section which starts at 2pm. They never arrive before 2pm but they all agree to arrive within berkeley time. That is, each person arrives uniformly distributed between 2pm and 2:10pm, independently. 

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)] 
\item A and B are two students in the section. What is the probability that A arrives at least 2 minutes before B? 
\begin{solution}[4cm] 
This problem is very similar to the previous problem. The difference is that the region is only one triangle. Thus, P(A arrives at least two minutes before B) = $\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{8}{10} \times \frac{8}{10} = 0.32$. 
\end{solution}

\item Find the probability that the event that the first person arrives before 2:02pm, and the last person arrives after 2:08pm. 
\begin{solution}[4cm] 
\textit{This problem shows that you don't always have to integrate the joint density in order to get the probability.} 

Let $X$ be the event that the first person to arrive arrives before 2:02pm and $Y$ be the event that the last person to arrive arrives after 2:08pm. Then, 
\begin{align*}
    P(X \cap Y) &= 1 - P(\neg (X \cap Y)) \\
                &= 1 - \ P(\neg X \cup \neg Y) \\
                &= 1 - P(\neg X) - P(\neg Y) + P(\neg X \cap \neg Y) \\
                &= 1 - (\frac{8}{10})^5 - (\frac{8}{10})^5+ {\frac{6}{10}}^5
\end{align*}

\end{solution}
\end{enumerate}
